        <h2>Ways to stop climate change</h2>
        <p>There are many simple ways we can help stop climate change. One big way is by using less energy—turn off lights when you’re not using them, and try to use energy-saving bulbs and appliances. Walking, biking, or taking the bus instead of using a car helps too, because cars burn fuel that adds to the problem. We can also use clean energy like wind and solar instead of burning oil or gas. Planting trees is another great way to help, since trees take in the bad gases from the air. Eating less meat and
            wasting less food also make a difference. Every little action helps when we all do our part.</p>
