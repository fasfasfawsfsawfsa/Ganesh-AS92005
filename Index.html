        <h2>What is climate change?</h2>
        <p>Climate change means the Earth is getting warmer over time.
            This is mostly because people burn things like coal, oil, and gas for energy, which puts gases into the air.<br>
            gases trap heat, kind of like a blanket around the planet. As a result, the weather is changingâ€”some places get
            others get more rain or stronger storms. Ice is melting in cold places, and sea levels are rising. This affects animals, <br>
            plants, and people too. It's a big problem, but one we can work together to solve..</p>
